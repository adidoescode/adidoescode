### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam, and I'm currently studying the web development program at Mittuniversitet in Sundsvall, Sweden. I'm currently working on version management, and I'm here on github to learn this skill.

In my free time I like to spend my time outdoors. I love hiking and camping and I also spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, Moa. 

I'd be up to collaborate on anything! I love meeting strangers and working together, and I know I would be of great help to anyone!
